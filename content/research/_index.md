<div class="research-content">
  Our lab is interested in <strong>attentional systems</strong> which are sometimes efficient and sometimes not. 
  How can we promote attentional selection? Why do we sometimes miss targets in visual search? 
  We focus primarily on <strong>psychophysics</strong>, but we are open to integrating various methods (e.g., EEG, fMRI) to deeply understand the human mind.
  Our lab’s philosophy is rooted in <strong>'use-inspired basic research'</strong>.

  <h2>1. Efficiency and Inefficiency of Attentional System</h2>
  <div class="research-content">
    The attentional system develops various strategies to process information efficiently, but these strategies are not always successful. When searching for target(s) in a display, attention is necessary to find what we are looking for, and sometimes it enables learning of statistical regularities to facilitate the search process. However, we often miss items even when they are attended to (i.e., <em>look-but-fail-to-see</em>), revealing the inherent limitations of human attention. Our lab explores the role of attention in balancing efficiency and inefficiency. We seek to find ways to maximize efficiency while minimizing the costs of inefficiency.
